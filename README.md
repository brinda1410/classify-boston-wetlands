# Identify Boston Wetlands

This project was undertaken as part of my stint as a Data Scientist with the City of Boston, Department of Innovation and Technology. 
Boston is facing climate related issues, such as extremely hot weather and risk of flooding, all of which can be mitigated by a natural resource 
present in the city, the wetlands. The goal is to help Boston's Environment Department to use satellite image data to identify wetlands and 
non-wetlands in the city, for better resource allocation by the city and the residents. 

This repository does not contain the image data used for training/testing the model.
